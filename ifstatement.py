# Conditional Statement is used for decision making in programming. 
# We are Peforming with the help of if, elif and else statements.

# Example 1: Simple if statement using user input

age = int(input("Enter the age: "))
if(age > 19):
    print("You are adult.")
    
# Example 2: if-else statement

marks = int(input("enter the marks: "))
if(marks > 33):
    print("you are passed in exam.")
else:
    print("you are failed in exam.")
    
# Example 3: if-elif-else statement

marks = int(input("enter the marks: "))
if(marks > 33):
    print("you are passed in exam.")
elif(marks == 33):
    print("you are promoted in exam. ")
else:
    print("you are failed in exam.")
    
    
# Thanks & End the Program.
